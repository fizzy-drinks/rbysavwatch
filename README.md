# Installing

Clone the repository, `cd` into its root directory and create a package:

```npm i
npm pack
```

Install the package that was created:

```
npm i -g rby-sav-to-txt-1.0.0.tgz
```

Run `rbysavwatch` from anywhere, specifying the save file and the destination of the text file with game data:

```
rbysavwatch pokemon-red.sav partyinfo.txt
```

Add the output file as a source to your favourite streaming software and use it.
